# Add-SetAOP-EasyAdmin
Easily add a "Set AOP" button in the "Server Management" tab in EasyAdmin. Also works with [Text formatting](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/text-formatting/)

# Fatal Warning
Make sure you do NOT overwrite your existing EasyAdmin folder, use a software that doesn't overwrite folders and only files.

## Warning
Make sure you already have the latest version of EasyAdmin installed(this script works on the latest version today[15/05/2024] which is 7.2), this script is barely tested so there might be bugs, if there are bugs just join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/eJfgfFtZ2r) and open a ticket.

# Install Instructions
>1. Extract the .zip
>
>2. Put the "EasyAdmin" folder into your resources/[system] folder(or a different one of your choosing/the one you have your EasyAdmin installed on).
>
>3. Add ensure/start(or whatever you use to start resources) easyadmin to your server.cfg if it's not already there (it should be there, since this "script" requires you to have it installed.)
>
>4. Restart your server
>
>5. That's it, it's installed
